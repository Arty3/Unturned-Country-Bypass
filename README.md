<h1 align="center">✨ Unturned Country Bypass ✨</h1>

<h6 align="center"><em>Simple loader which patches Unturned, bypassing country restrictions</em></h6>

## 📝 Overview

This simple utility program patches Unturned in order to bypass set country restrictions for store items and purchasing, namely the Netherlands and Belgium. The game is run without battleye when doing this, however you will be able to make purchases in the store as if in another country.

The module itself was already compiled for the sake of avoiding the hassle of setting it up,
however the actual loader is a different program, you can find it in the release section, or [compile](#-installation) it from source.

Note: Use at your own risk, you will not get banned, but it is still not intended behavior.

## 🛠 Requirements

- [GoLang](https://go.dev/)

## 🚀 Installation

You can grab the compiled program from the release section, otherwise you can compile it from source.

Simply install golang, then run:

```sh
compile.bat
```

You can do this both in the terminal or by double clicking the file itself.

You should then see a directory named `build/`.<br>
Inside you should find `loader.exe`, run it as administrator and enjoy!
